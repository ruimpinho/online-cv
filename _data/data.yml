    assignments:
      - title: ROSE - Robot Sensing for Tele-Ecography
        link: "https://youtu.be/b-PXUVOqjZY"
        tagline: "ROSE is the ultimate telemedicine solution for remote ultrasound examinations on any part of the world. The doctor can work from a central hospital or even his own home, while the patients are remotely diagnosed from their nearest health center.
        I built the user interface and worked on a video transmission method using the API from an ultrasound probe.
        We took ROSE to the largest radiology trade fair in the world, RSNA Annual Meeting (Chicago, USA). It was a great experience to showcase my soft skills as a team player, public speaker, among others."

        link: "https://www.physiosensing.net/"
        tagline: "I built a software module for PhysioSensing, a medical device measuring feet pressure for physical rehabilitation. The main tech stack consists of C#, WPF and SQL (database to store and access patient data). This module was built by a team of 2. I made my commits with Sourcetree. Our team defined the sprints/goals using Atlassian Jira."
